# Windows App Demo (C#)

We designed a Windows app in C# (on the .NET platform) to interface with the wearable patches ([link to Our Wearable Patches!](https://github.com/mohnikbakht/Cardio_Wearable_Patch)) . This interface works in two modes:

1) Connected to the device through Bluetooth LE: In this mode the user can send commands to the devices as well as receive and plot the data in real time. Up to 4 devices can connect and send data at the same time. The recording can be saved as a .csv file and also emailed to the user. The user can also monitor the files in the SD card.

2) Connected to the device using a USB cable: In this mode user can transfer the data recorded in the SD card to the computer in a .csv format.

## Demo

The image below shows a screenshot of the app when collecting data from 4 wearable patches at the same time.
