# Windows App Demo

We designed a Windows app in C# (on the .NET platform) to interface with the wireless patches. This interface works in two modes:

1) Connected to the device through Bluetooth LE: In this mode the user can send commands to the devices as well as receive and plot the data in real time. The recording can be saved as a .csv file and also emailed to the user. The user can also monitor the files in the SD card.

2) Connected to the device using a USB cable: In this mode user can transfer the data recorded in the SD card to the computer in a .csv format.
